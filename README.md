The following versions of software were used when working on this project.
Python Version: 3.6
Numpy Version: 1.13.3
Scipy Version: 0.19.1
Matplotlib Version: 2.1.0

Project: The Dynamics of Solitons. Undertaken as part of the Computational Physics module during my undergraduate degree at Imperial College London.

This project contains the following:
Animation Scripts - Singe_Soliton_ani.py, Singe_Soliton_Compare_ani.py, Two_Solitons_ani.py, Two_Solitons_Overlay_ani.py, Shockwave_ani.py
Plot Generating Scripts - Wave_Breaking_Plot.py, Speed_of_Soliton_Plot.py, Momentum_and_Energy_Plots.py, Heat_Map_Generator.py, Propagated_Error_Plots.py

The animation scripts are self-contained.
All the functions used in the plot generating scripts are imported from Functions.py

Each of the plot generating scripts may have customisable parameters for the functions. However, there are default values set to 
allow the user to generate all plots without doing anything at all (except pressing the run button).
